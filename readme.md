# Last Before Pandemic

This is basic JavaScript educational project.
<br><br>
"Le voyageur" pretends to be a travel agency website. Form of sliding banner image / hero carousel could present current offers - suggesting to get inspired basing on the slideshow. Perfect to be incorporated into landing page as a range of mainly promoted products / seasonal offers.
<br><br>

### Future developement ideas

<br>

- introduce booking button
- introduce transparent buttons PREV/NEXT expanded on full height of banner, dividing it on left and right halves.
  <br><br>

### Credits:
